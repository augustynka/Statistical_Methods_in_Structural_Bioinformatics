# Statistical Methods in Structural Bioinformatics

This repository gathers a series of Jupyter notebooks exploring computational and statistical methods for structure analysis:

- **Lab 1: Structure Quality & Comparison**  
  Compute and visualize key metrics (RMSD, LDDT, TM-score, GDT) and identify steric clashes to assess model accuracy.

- **Lab 2: Bayesian Analysis of Riboswitches**  
  Apply Bayesian inference to characterize ligand-dependent RNA folding and regulatory mechanisms.

- **Lab 3: Markov Chains & Hidden Markov Models**  
  Build and train HMMs for sequence annotation, motif discovery, and secondary‚Äêstructure prediction.

- **Lab 4: Statistical Physics of Biomolecular Systems**  
  Use principles from statistical mechanics to model RNA folding landscapes and thermodynamic ensembles.

- **Lab 5: Directional Statistics**  
  Analyze angular data (e.g., backbone dihedrals) with von Mises and other circular distributions to study conformational preferences.
